    <div class="results-para">
        <p class="results-para">I started my research by conducting an online survey in order to understand the
           users and to find out what they’re looking for in a cloud storage system.
           Majority of users are already utilizing cloud storage to some degree. One pain
           point is that they often “dump” their content into the dashboard so they’re
           looking for an efficient way to organize their files. With these factors in mind, I
           went onto competitive analysis of the current cloud storage market.</p>

          <p>I SWOT analyzed several of the top cloud service companies: Google Drive, Dropbox, and
            Amazon Drive. Google Drive offers a generous amount of free storage before upgrading to paid plan;
            however their dashboard has a busy feel with many features. On the other hand, Dropbox has a
            polished interface with an intuitive dashboard but their paid plans are more expensive than
             other options. Amazon Drive has unlimited photo storage, but users must first be paid members.
             With these features in mind, I focused on a simple yet functional product for users to organize their contents.</p>

            using Sketch. Along with submitting these vectors for feedback from fellow mentors and colleagues, I did  A/B
            testing to determine the final design. The final design was inspired by a library catalog as it holds a large volume of information within a compact space, which is what Store.it offers to
            users. </p>

    <div class="iterations-para">
      <p>After wireframing, I created high-fidelity mockups. During this step of the design process,
         “iterate” was my mantra. For my homepage’s  v.1, I got feedback from mentors and colleauges that my spacing, grids,
        color, and layout needed to improve. So, after several versions, my final design included
        angles to break up the monotony of the layout, to incorporate more of my color palette, and
        to strategically use white space.</p>
      <img src="images/homepage-v1.png" alt="homepage iterations" class="iteration-img"/>
      <img src="images/homepage-final.png" alt="homepage iterations" class="iteration-img"/>

      <p>The dashboard also required several user testing and iterations. I wanted the dashboard to have a clean, bright vibe, but I overdid it as I got responses that it’s too white and harsh on the eyes and the proportions seemed off (v.1).

So, I modified the dashboard’s dimensions andI added a darker top and left-side nav bar (v.2), and eventually used red to distinguish the two header sections (v.3).

I was satisfied with v.3 , but after another round of testing, users’ comments compelled me to make more changes. </p>
      <p>Users said it was jarring to see clear images next to plain text. It was also hard to see the little icon in the top left-corner to indicate the file type.

So based on the feedback, in v.4, I added gray tiles at lower opacity with the file icon in the middle to help users see right away what kind of file it is and to give the dashboard a more uniform look.

I also lightened the dashboard as majority of users wanted something “less constricting” and “airer.”</p>

      <p>Going back to the drawing board countless times was initially discouraging. In retrospect, though, going back to further brainstorm and sketch pushed me to generate better ideas, which in the end is a huge plus for users.
          
      Also, I learned to keep my user personas handy as I frequently referred to it. Even after iterations, I double-checked with the personas to ensure I’m staying focused on the users’ wants. Along with remembering my personas, I definitely needed to test, test, test and let the data speak for itself instead of letting my bias slip in.
          
      If given more time, I’d like to include a welcome tour at the first onboarding experience where users have the option to get a quick tour of the features. </p>
