  <section class="prob-solution">

        <h3>What is Store.it?</h3>
        <p>It’s a SaaS web application that’s a go-to place to <br> easily
          store, organize and share information. It has a <br> clean &
          functional interface where users can start <br> using it at the
          first login.</p>
    <div class="prob-solution-right-side">
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>Need a convenient place to save and share online <br>content, such
          as notes, links and images</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Design a web application where users can easily <br> save and share
           information. The app must be easy to <br> use and accessible
           anywhere.
    </div>
  </section>

<!-- User research -->
<section class="research">
    <h3 class="results-side-header">User Research</h3>
      <p class="results-para">I started my research by conducting an online survey in order to understand the <br>
         users and to find out what they’re looking for in a cloud storage system. <br>
         Majority of users are already utilizing cloud storage to some degree. One pain<br>
         point is that they often “dump” their content into the dashboard so they’re <br>
         looking for an efficient way to organize their files. With these factors in mind, I <br>
         went onto competitive analysis of the current cloud storage market.</p>
    <div class="results-percent">
      <h4>86%</h4>
      <p class="percent-desc">of users utilize cloud storage</p>
      <h4>72%</h4>
      <p class="percent-desc">of those users utilize Google Drive</p>
      <h4>84%</h4>
      <p class="percent-desc">of users want something that’s free</p>
      <h4>92%</h4>
      <p class="percent-desc">of users use cloud storage on multiple devices
		(e.g. laptop, mobile)</p>
      <h4>68%</h4>
      <p class="percent-desc">of users they want an efficient way to organize
		      their files</p>
    </div>
</section>

<!-- Competitive Analysis -->
  <section class="comp-analysis">
    <h3 class="ana-side-header">Competitive Analysis</h3>
      <p class="ana-para">I SWOT analyzed several of the top cloud service companies: Google Drive, Dropbox, and <br>
        Amazon Drive. Google Drive offers a generous amount of free storage before upgrading to paid plan; <br>
        however their dashboard has a busy feel with many features. On the other hand, Dropbox has a <br>
        polished interface with an intuitive dashboard but their paid plans are more expensive than <br>
         other options. Amazon Drive has unlimited photo storage, but users must first be paid members.<br>
         With these features in mind, I focused on a simple yet functional product for users to organize their contents.

<!-- Bottom Line -->
  <section class="bottom-line">
      <h3 class="bottom-line-center">Bottom Line: What do users wants?</h3>
      <ol class="bottom-line-para">
        <li>Service that is free and affordable</li>
        <li>App that’s accessible on whatever device, wherever they are</li>
        <li>Efficient way to organize the collected information</li>
      </ol>
  </section>

<!-- User Personas -->
  <section class="personas">
    <h3 class="persona-side-header">User Persona</h3>
      <p class="first-liner">After the research phase, I created user personas to represent the goals and<br>
         behaviors of potential users.</p>

<!-- User Stories -->
  <section class="user-stories">
      <h3 class="stories-side-header">User Stories</h3>
      <p class="stories-para">Based on the survey data and competitive analysis, I created user stories to highlight<br>
        the main features of the product. These user stories prioritize the MVP for new <br> and returning users.
        The following are examples of a returning user tasks.</p>
      <img src="" alt="returning user tasks"/>

<!-- User Flows -->
  <section class="user-flows">
      <h3 class="flows-side-header">User Flows</h3>
      <p class="flows-para">Then, I converted the user stories into user flows to show how the user would interact with<br>
         the product. The user flows focused on onboarding and navigating the dashboard, such as <br>
         this user flow for a returning user.</p>

      <a href="" class="button" id="moreUserFlows">View More User Flows</a>

<!-- Branding -->
  <section class="branding">
      <h3 class="branding-side-header">Branding</h3>
      <p class="branding-para">In order to develop the concept, I did a mind map on “organize” and “storage.” <br>
        This helped me to generate various logo sketches, which I then converted into vector drawings<br>
        using Sketch. Along with submitting these vectors for feedback from fellow mentors and colleagues, <br>I did  A/B
        testing to determine the final design. The final design was inspired by a library catalog as it<br>holds a large volume of information within a compact space, which is what Store.it offers to <br>
        users. </p>
      <img src="" alt="logos"/>

<!-- Wireframes -->
  <section class="wireframes">
      <h3 class="wireframes-side-header">Wireframes</h3>
      <p class="wireframes-para">Next, I created wireframes to show the functionality of the product. Here are examples of the<br>
         dashboard and main features.  </p>
      <img src="" alt="link wireframe"/>
      <img src="" alt="img wireframe"/>
      <img src="" alt="note wireframe"/>
      <a href="" class="button" id="moreWireframes">View More Wireframes</a>

<!-- Testing & Iterations -->
  <section class="iterations">
      <h3 class="iterations-side-header">User Testing Iterations</h3>
      <p class="iterations-para-1">After wireframing, I created high-fidelity mockups. During this step of the design process,<br>
         “iterate” was my mantra. For my homepage’s  v.1, I got feedback from mentors and colleauges that my spacing, grids, <br>
        color, and layout needed to improve. So, after several versions, my final design included <br>
        angles to break up the monotony of the layout, to incorporate more of my color palette, and <br>
        to strategically use white space.</p>
      <img src="" alt="homepage v1"/>
      <img src="" alt="homepage final"/>
      <p class="iterations-para-2-l">The dashboard also required several user testing and iterations. I wanted the dashboard to have a clean, bright vibe, but I overdid it as I got responses that it’s too white and harsh on the eyes and the proportions seemed off (v.1).

So, I modified the dashboard’s dimensions andI added a darker top and left-side nav bar (v.2), and eventually used red to distinguish the two header sections (v.3).

I was satisfied with v.3 , but after another round of testing, users’ comments compelled me to make more changes. </p>
      <p class="iterations-para-2-r">Users said it was jarring to see clear images next to plain text. It was also hard to see the little icon in the top left-corner to indicate the file type.

So based on the feedback, in v.4, I added gray tiles at lower opacity with the file icon in the middle to help users see right away what kind of file it is and to give the dashboard a more uniform look.

I also lightened the dashboard as majority of users wanted something “less constricting” and “airer.”</p>
      <img src="" alt="dashboard v1"/>
      <img src="" alt="dashboard v2"/>
      <img src="" alt="dashboard v3"/>
      <img src="" alt="dashboard final"/>

<!-- What I learned -->
  <section class="learned">
      <h3 class="learned-side-header">What I Learned</h3>
      <p class="learned-para">Going back to the drawing board countless times was initially a major bummer. In retrospect, though, going back to further brainstorm and sketch pushed me to generate better ideas, which in the end is a huge plus for users.

Also, I learned to keep my user personas handy as I frequently referred to it. Even after iterations, I double-checked with the personas to ensure I’m staying focused on the users’ wants. Along with remembering my personas, I definitely needed to test, test, test and let the data speak for itself instead of letting my bias slip in.

If given more time, I’d like to include a welcome tour at the first onboarding experience where users have the option to get a quick tour of the features. </p>
